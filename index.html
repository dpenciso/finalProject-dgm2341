							<h2>Who is Zayn</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Zain Javadd Malik, known mononymously as Zayn, is an English singer and songwriter.</p>
						<p>Born and raised in Bradford, West Yorkshire, Malik auditioned as a solo contestant for the British music competition The X Factor in 2010. After being eliminated as a solo performer, Malik was brought back into the competition, along with four other contestants, to form the boy band that would later be known as One Direction. Malik left the group in March 2015 and subsequently signed a solo recording contract with RCA Records.</p>
						<p>Adopting a more alternative R&B music style with his debut studio album Mind of Mine (2016) and its lead single, "Pillowtalk", Malik became the first British male artist to debut at number one in both the UK and US, with his debut single and debut album. His subsequent singles, including "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" with Taylor Swift, and "Dusk Till Dawn" featuring Sia, were also hits. In December 2018, he released his second studio album, Icarus Falls.</p>
						<p>Malik is the recipient of several accolades, including an American Music Award, Billboard Music Award and MTV Video Music Award.</p>
